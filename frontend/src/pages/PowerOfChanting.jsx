        <p className="quote">The Supreme Method for This Age - Srila Prabhupada's Gift to the World</p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2 className="section-title">The Maha Mantra</h2>
          <div className="verse">
            Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare<br />
            Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare
          </div>
          <p>Srila Prabhupada brought this mantra from India to the Western world in 1965. He writes: "This sixteen-word, thirty-two-syllable mantra is the maha-mantra, or the great chanting for deliverance."</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2 className="section-title">The Only Way for This Age</h2>
          <p>Srila Prabhupada emphasized the prophecy from Brihan-naradiya Purana:</p>
          <div className="verse">
            "harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam<br/>
            kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā"
          </div>
          <p><strong>Translation:</strong> "In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way."</p>
          <p>He writes: "This is not a sentimental statement. It is confirmed by all Vedic literature and by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself."</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2 className="section-title">The Holy Name is Non-Different from Krishna</h2>
          <p>Srila Prabhupada explains from Padma Purana:</p>
          <div className="verse">
            "The holy name of Krishna is transcendentally blissful. It bestows all spiritual benedictions, for it is Krishna Himself, the reservoir of all pleasure. Krishna's name is complete, and it is the form of all transcendental mellows. It is not a material name under any condition, and it is no less powerful than Krishna Himself."
          </div>
          <p>He writes: "When you chant Hare Krishna, Krishna dances on your tongue. The name and the named are identical in the absolute platform."</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2 className="section-title">Chanting Cleanses the Heart</h2>
          <p>Srila Prabhupada quotes Lord Caitanya's Siksastaka:</p>
          <div className="verse">
            "ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ"
          </div>
          <p><strong>Translation:</strong> "The holy name cleanses the mirror of the heart and extinguishes the fire of material existence."</p>
          <p>He explains: "Our consciousness is covered by material contamination—lust, anger, greed, envy, illusion, and madness. Chanting Hare Krishna removes this dirt layer by layer, revealing our original pure consciousness."</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2 className="section-title">The Process: Chant 16 Rounds Daily</h2>
          <p>Srila Prabhupada established the standard: "A serious devotee should chant at least 16 rounds of the Hare Krishna mantra daily on beads."</p>
          <ul>
            <li>One round = 108 repetitions of the maha-mantra</li>
            <li>16 rounds = 1,728 repetitions</li>
            <li>Takes approximately 2 hours</li>
          </ul>
          <p>He writes: "If you cannot chant 16 rounds, chant at least 4 rounds. But try to increase. The more you chant, the more you advance."</p>
        </div>
