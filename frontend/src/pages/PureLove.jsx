          <h2 className="section-title">The Definition of Pure Love (Prema)</h2>
          <p>Srila Prabhupada explains that pure love (prema) is completely selfless devotion to Krishna. He writes: "Prema means love without any expectation of return. It is unconditional, unbreakable, and eternal."</p>
          <div className="verse">
            "When one is established in loving service to the Lord, one's love is not dependent on any material condition. It is unconditional and unbreakable." - Srila Prabhupada

        <div className="section">
          <h2 className="section-title">Material Love vs Spiritual Love</h2>
          <p>Srila Prabhupada distinguishes between material and spiritual love:</p>
          <div className="verse">
            "In the material world, so-called love is actually lust. It is based on sense gratification and bodily identification. When the body changes or desires are not fulfilled, this 'love' disappears. But spiritual love is eternal because it is based on the relationship between the eternal soul and the eternal Supreme Soul, Krishna."
          </div>
          <p>He writes: "Material love is selfish—'I love you because you give me pleasure.' But spiritual love is selfless—'I love you for your pleasure, not mine.'"</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2 className="section-title">Srimati Radharani: The Embodiment of Pure Love</h2>
          <p>Srila Prabhupada describes Srimati Radharani as the supreme example of pure love:</p>
          <div className="verse">
            "Radharani's love for Krishna is so pure that She has no desire for Her own happiness. Her only desire is Krishna's happiness. This is the perfection of love."
          </div>
          <p>He quotes from Caitanya Caritamrita: "Radharani says to Krishna: 'You may embrace Me or trample Me under Your feet, or You may make Me brokenhearted by not being present before Me. You are completely free to do anything and everything, for You are always My worshipable Lord, unconditionally.'"</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2 className="section-title">Is Pure Love Possible in This World?</h2>
          <p>Srila Prabhupada assures us: "Yes! Pure love of Krishna is not only possible, it is our natural, constitutional position. We are all eternal servants of Krishna, and loving Him is our eternal nature. It is simply covered by material contamination."</p>
          <div className="verse">
            "Living entities are eternally connected with Krishna in a relationship of service. This relationship is called prema, or love." - Srila Prabhupada
          </div>
          <p>He writes: "By the process of bhakti-yoga, especially by chanting Hare Krishna, this dormant love is awakened."</p>
        </div>

          <div className="verse">
            "The perfection of life is simply to satisfy the Supreme Lord. When Krishna is satisfied, everyone is satisfied, just as when the root of a tree is watered, all branches and leaves are nourished." - Srimad Bhagavatam 1.2.13
          </div>
          <p>He writes: "The world is suffering because love is misdirected. People are trying to love their country, family, or themselves. But real satisfaction comes only when we love Krishna. Then we can truly love everyone because we see everyone as Krishna's children."</p>
